    The ``append`` method can be used to insert one parameterized
    gate instance into multiple circuits. This fix detects how many
    instances an inserted parameterized gate has, and will make a
    deepcopy of the instance if needed to ensure that changing a
    parameter in one circuit will not affect other circuits.
